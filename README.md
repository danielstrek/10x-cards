## Project Name
10x-Astro-Starter

## Project Description
This project, named 10x-cards, enables users to quickly create and manage educational flashcard sets. It uses LLM models via an API to generate flashcard suggestions based on provided text, addressing the problem of time-consuming manual flashcard creation and simplifying spaced repetition learning.

## Tech Stack
- Astro 5: For building fast, content-focused websites.
- TypeScript 5: For type-safe JavaScript development.
- React 19: For creating interactive user interfaces.
- Tailwind 4: For utility-first CSS styling.
- Shadcn/ui: For reusable UI components.

## Getting Started Locally
To set up and run the project locally:
1. Ensure you have Node.js installed (version specified in .nvmrc: 22.14.0). If using nvm, run `nvm use` in the project root.
2. Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory.
3. Install dependencies by running `npm install`.
4. Start the development server with the appropriate script.

## Available Scripts
In the project, you can use the following npm scripts:
- `npm run dev`: Starts the development server.
- `npm run build`: Builds the project for production.
- `npm run preview`: Previews the production build.
- `npm run astro`: Runs Astro CLI commands.
- `npm run lint`: Lints the code for errors.
- `npm run lint:fix`: Automatically fixes linting issues.
- `npm run format`: Formats the code using Prettier.

## Project Scope
The project focuses on providing a starter template for Astro applications, including basic pages, components, and API endpoints. It covers core features like automatic flashcard generation, manual creation, user authentication, and integration with a spaced repetition algorithm (using an open-source library). Boundaries include no advanced features in the MVP, such as gamification, mobile apps, or public API sharing.

## Project Status
The project is in active development, with the current version at 0.0.1. It is stable for local testing but may require updates based on evolving dependencies.
